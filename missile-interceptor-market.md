<p><strong>The Missile Interceptor Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endoatmospheric</li><li>Exoatmospheric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The missile interceptor market comprises two key applications: endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric interceptors. Endoatmospheric interceptors operate within the Earth's atmosphere, targeting shorter-range missiles during their flight. These systems rely on kinetic impact and explosive warheads for interception. In contrast, exoatmospheric interceptors function outside the atmosphere, engaging long-range ballistic threats during their midcourse phase. This distinction affects their technology, effectiveness, and deployment strategies, catering to varying defense needs against diverse missile threats in modern military warfare.</p></p>
