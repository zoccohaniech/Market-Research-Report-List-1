<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulsed Electric Field Ablation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Electroporation Technology</li><li>Irreversible Electroporation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pulsed Electric Field Ablation System market is divided into two main types based on the effects of electric fields on cell membranes: reversible electroporation and irreversible electroporation. Reversible electroporation temporarily permeabilizes cells, allowing for the delivery of therapeutic agents without damaging cell integrity, making it ideal for applications like gene therapy. In contrast, irreversible electroporation leads to permanent cell membrane disruption, resulting in cell death, which is effective for tumor ablation and tissue destruction in various medical procedures.</p></p>
