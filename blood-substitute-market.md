<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Substitute Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HBOC</li><li>PFBOC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blood substitute market consists mainly of two types: Hemoglobin-based Oxygen Carriers (HBOCs) and Perfluorocarbon-based Oxygen Carriers (PFBOCs). HBOCs utilize modified hemoglobin to transport oxygen, aiming to mimic the functions of red blood cells while potentially overcoming storage and compatibility issues. PFBOCs employ perfluorocarbon compounds that can dissolve and transport oxygen, offering an alternative method without relying on hemoglobin. Both types are explored for their ability to address blood shortages and improve patient outcomes in transfusion scenarios.</p></p>
