<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sealless Centrifugal Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetic Drive Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Shielding Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sealless centrifugal pumps are designed to eliminate leakage and improve safety in various applications. The magnetic drive centrifugal pump utilizes a magnetic coupling to transfer energy, completely isolating the motor from the pumped fluid. This minimizes the risk of contamination and enhances efficiency. Shielding pumps, on the other hand, employ a protective barrier to prevent leakage, often using a secondary containment system. Both types cater to industries requiring reliable, safe, and environmentally responsible pumping solutions, particularly in handling hazardous or sensitive fluids.</p></p>
